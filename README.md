I wanted to write a really good level generator. I have not done that! 

I've done the next best thing though and written a little gui program that follows thhe Cogmind guy's advice for how to audit a level generator.

Use the left and right arrows to step through levels (you can, for instance, hold right to see a large number of levels in sequence) and use WSAD to move the camera. Levels are plotted on an infinite grid.

The builtin level generator is _very_ basic, as you no doubt see!
